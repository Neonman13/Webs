    <h2>Why it's good to be an optimist?</h2>
    <br>
    <h1>Hope u had good day today!</h2>
    <p>Optimists are more self-confident, more
     creative and more pleasant to communicate with. People for whom a good mood
     is the norm of life, are more stress-resistant and make decisions more easily.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>The first reason is, of course, health!</h1>
    <p>

        Scientists are already tired of repeating that all diseases are caused by nerves, 
        that a long stay in a gloomy mood provokes many diseases in the body. Chronic stress, 
        irritation, suppressed anger provoke cardiovascular diseases, weakened immunity, arthritis,
         diabetes and other troubles.
        And all of us, it seems, have heard about it a thousand times, but for
         some reason we constantly allow ourselves to be tormented by imaginary experiences
          and unpleasant people. And if you stop and think for a second - is it worth bathing 
          in negativity to earn health problems? Yes, maybe,
         after all, it is better to look around and find at least a small reason for joy?
       </p>
       <br>
       <h1>The second reason: when we are in a good mood, the world seems better and brighter, and the people around us are kinder and friendlier.</h1>
       <p>And, on the contrary, in a bad mood, the surrounding reality seems to be an accumulation of negativity, and people seem angry and suspicious.
        Experiments by scientists revealed that in a state of depression, people
         tend to remember the bad attitude of their parents towards them in childhood. 
         When the subjects returned
         to their normal mood, they talked about their parentswarmly, 
         and remembered only good things. Even the brightness of the colors 
         of the world around you depends on your mood. Scientists have proven 
         that in a good mood, the information about color that enters the human 
         brain is more complete than that which a person perceives in a bad mood.
          Do you want to live in a bright and positive world filled with friendly
           and kind people? Just cheer yourself
          up - and the world will smile back at you!</p>
